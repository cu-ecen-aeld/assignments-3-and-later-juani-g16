# Faulty module error

1. **Error message:**
```
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
```
- This indicates that the kernel attempted to access a NULL pointer, which caused a page fault.

2. **Memory Abort Information:**
```
Mem abort info:
  ESR = 0x0000000096000045
  EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits
  SET = 0, FnV = 0
  EA = 0, S1PTW = 0
  FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault
```
- **ESR (Exception Syndrome Register):** Provides details about the exception.
- **EC (Exception Class):** 0x25 indicates a Data Abort exception in the current Exception Level (EL).
- **FSC (Fault Status Code):** 0x05 indicates a level 1 translation fault, meaning the address translation failed at level 1.
3. **Data abortion info:**
```
Data abort info:
ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000045
CM = 0, WnR = 1
```
- **WnR (Write not Read):** 1 indicates that the fault occurred during a write operation.

4. **User Page Table Information:**
```
user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000041bc5000
[0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000
```
- This indicates that the page table entries for the address 0x0000000000000000 are all zero, meaning the address is not mapped.

5. **Internal error:**
```
Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000045 
[#1] SMP
```
- This is an internal kernel error (Oops) with the same ESR value as above.

6. **Modules Linked:**

```
Modules linked in: hello(O) faulty(O) scull(O)
```
- The faulty module is linked, which is likely the source of the error.
7. **CPU and Process Information:**
```
CPU: 0 PID: 153 Comm: sh Tainted: G           O       6.1.44 #1
Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)
```
- The error occurred on CPU 0, in process ID 153 (sh), and the kernel is tainted due to the use of out-of-tree modules (O).

8. **Processor State:**
```
pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)
```
- The processor state at the time of the fault.

9. **Program Counter and Link Register:**
```
pc : faulty_write+0x10/0x20 [faulty]
lr : vfs_write+0xc8/0x390
```
- The program counter (pc) was at faulty_write+0x10, indicating the fault occurred in the faulty_write function.
- The link register (lr) was at vfs_write+0xc8, indicating the call to faulty_write was made from vfs_write.
10. **Stack Pointer and Registers:**
```
sp : ffffffc008dfbd20
x29: ffffffc008dfbd80 x28: ffffff8001aa5cc0 x27: 0000000000000000

x2 : 0000000000000012 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000
```
- The stack pointer (sp) and other registers at the time of the fault.
- Notably, x0 is 0, indicating a NULL pointer was passed as an argument.

11. **Call Trace:**
```

---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---
```
- The call trace shows the sequence of function calls leading to the fault.
- The fault occurred in faulty_write, which was called by ksys_write.

## Conclusion
The error occurred because the faulty_write function attempted to dereference a NULL pointer. This caused a kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0x0000000000000000, leading to a page fault and an Oops error.
